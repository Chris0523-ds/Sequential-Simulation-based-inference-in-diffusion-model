# Sequential-Simulation-based-inference-in-diffusion-model

Hello! I am Wang Dongshan. This code is the implementation for my dissertation during the MSc in Statistics program (2023/24 academic year) in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick. The dissertation is titled *Sequential Denoising Diffusion Models for Simulation-Based Inference.*

The topic of this dissertation explores the performance of applying diffusion models to address simulation-based inference problems in the Bayesian domain. It investigates issues such as the optimal number of rounds for sequential methods and the selection of stochastic differential equations, conducting experiments with VPSDE, VESDE, and SUB-VPSDE. 

The inspiration for this method primarily comes from two papers: Louis Sharrock's *Sequential Neural Score Estimation: Likelihood-Free Inference with Conditional Score-Based Diffusion Models* and Tomas Geffner's *Compositional Score Modeling for Simulation-Based Inference.* These parallel works were the first to apply diffusion models to simulation-based inference (SBI) problems and achieved outstanding results. 

If you have any questions about this code or related topics on SBI and diffusion models, feel free to contact me at Dongshan.Wang@warwick.ac.uk.
